= response_for

response_for (see Ardes::ResponseFor::ClassMethods) allows you to decorate the respond_to block of actions on sublcassed controllers.  This works nicely with http://plugins.ardes.com/doc/resources_controller

=== Example

  class FooController < ApplicationController
    def index
      @foos = Foo.find(:all)
    end
    
    def show
      @foo = Foo.find(params[:id])
    end
  end
  
  # this controller needs to respond_to fbml on index, and
  # js, html and xml (templates) on index and show
  class SpecialFooController < FooController
    response_for :index do |format|
      format.fbml { render :inline => turn_into_facebook(@foos) }
    end
    
    response_for :index, :show, :types => [:html, :xml, :js]
  end
  
=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Testing
RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.
