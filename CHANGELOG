* 0.2.2 - Fixed bug where response_for would clobber a respond_to if if the respond_to relied on default render [thanks Tom Stuart for the bug report]

* Added VERSION introspection, this is 0.2.1

* To facilitate making reusable chunks of actions and responses, simply extend Ardes::ResponsesModule into
  your action modules.  See Ardes::ResponsesModule for details

* now intercepting template_exists? to decide whether to render a response for an action
  that has no action method defined.  (Removes somewhat mysterious behaviour of empty
  actions being defined)

* tagged v0.2.0 - API change, and major internal simplifications - see http://blog.ardes.com/response_for

* tagged v0.1.0
  
* initial release of response_for
