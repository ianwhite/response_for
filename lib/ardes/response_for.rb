      # response_for allows you to specify a default response for your actions that don't specify a
      # respond_to block.
      # 
      # Using response_for, you may keep the response logic out of the action, so that it can be overriden easily
      # without having to rewrite the entire action.  This is very useful when subclassing controllers.
      #
      # == Usage
      #
      #   response_for :action1 [, :action2], [,:types => [:mime, :type, :list]] [ do |format| ... end] # or
      #
      # === Example
      #
      #   class FooController < ApplicationController
      #     def index
      #       @foos = Foo.find(:all)
      #     end
      #   
      #     def show
      #       @foo = Foo.find(params[:id])
      #     end
      #   end
      #   
      #   # this controller needs to respond_to fbml on index, and
      #   # js, html and xml (templates) on index and show
      #   class SpecialFooController < FooController
      #     response_for :index do |format|
      #       format.fbml { render :inline => turn_into_facebook(@foos) }
      #     end
      #   
      #     response_for :index, :show, :types => [:html, :xml, :js]
      #   end
      #
      # === when response_for kicks in
      # 
      # response_for only kicks in if the action (or any filters) have not already redirected or rendered.
      # 
      # This means that if you foresee wanting to override your action's responses, you should write them without
      # a respond_to block, but with a response_for block (the latter can be overridden by subsequent response_fors, the 
      # former cannot)
      # 
      # === Other examples 
      #
      #   response_for :index, :types => [:fbml]    # index will respond to fbml and try to render, say, index.fbml.builder
      #
      #   response_for :update do |format|          # this example is for a resources_controller controller
      #     if !(resource.new_record? || resource.changed?) # => resource.saved?
      #       format.js { render(:update) {|page| page.replace dom_id(resource), :partial => resource }}
      #     else
      #       format.js { render(:update) {|page| page.visual_effect :shake, dom_id(resource) }}
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # === Notes
      #
      # * If the before_filters or action renders or redirects, then response_for will not be invoked.
      # * you can stack up multiple response_for calls, the most recent has precedence
      # * the specifed block is executed within the controller instance, so you can use controller
      #   instance methods and instance variables (i.e. you can make it look just like a regular
      #   respond_to block).
      # * you can add a response_for an action that has no action method defined.  This is just like
      #   defining a template for an action that has no action method defined.
      # * you can combine the :types option with a block, the block has precedence if you specify the
      #   same mime type in both.
